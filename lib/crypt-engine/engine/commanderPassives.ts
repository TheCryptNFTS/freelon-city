/**
 * Commander passives — mechanical identity for the five curated commanders.
 *
 * Previously the curated commanders carried a descriptive `passive` STRING in
 * design/commanderSpecs.ts that nothing ever read, so a commander only shaped a
 * deck's construction rules and had zero in-match effect. This module gives each
 * curated commander ONE clean, deterministic, low-blast-radius passive, hooked at
 * a single point in the reducer:
 *
 *   cmd_stone_warden  (Bulwark)   summoned GUARD units enter with +0/+2  [onUnitSummon]
 *   cmd_iron_warlord  (Warmonger) each equip grants the unit +1 Attack   [onEquip]
 *   cmd_bronze_raider (Raid)      summoned units costing <=3 gain RUSH   [onUnitSummon]
 *   cmd_silver_oracle (Foresight) start of turn: Scry 2 (smooth top 2)   [onTurnStart]
 *   cmd_golden_emperor(Opulence)  summoned cost-5+ units enter with +1/+1[onUnitSummon]
 *
 * All hooks are PURE-IN-PLACE: they mutate the already-cloned state the reducer
 * hands them (mirroring effectResolver). A commander id with no entry here — every
 * generated `cmd_6xxx` NFT commander, and the demo opponent's commander — is a
 * clean no-op, so passives only ever fire for the five hand-authored commanders.
