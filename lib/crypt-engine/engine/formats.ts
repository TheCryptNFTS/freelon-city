/**
 * FORMATS (PART 2) — curated, rotating deckbuilding legality.
 *
 * Two formats today:
 *   - "Open"  — the FULL pool of 4129 playable cards is legal. This is the historical
 *               behavior and the DEFAULT: `validateDeck(deck, commanderId, opts)` with no
 *               format (or format === "Open") is byte-identical to before, so every existing
 *               caller and the committed fixtures are unmoved.
 *   - "Core"  — a designed ~200-card curated subset. A deck is Core-legal only if EVERY card
 *               is in the Core set (on top of the normal size / copy / faction rules). This is
 *               the lever for a smaller, more legible, rotatable constructed environment.
 *
 * The Core set is DERIVED BY RULE (not a hand-maintained id list) from `allPlayableCards`, so
 * it stays correct as the catalog evolves and is fully deterministic (pure function of the
 * catalog + a fixed, sorted-by-id selection). See `CORE_SELECTION` below for the exact rule.

 * CORE SELECTION RULE (the IP is the rule, not a frozen list):
 *
 *   For each (faction × rarity) bucket, sorted by card id for determinism, take up to:
 *     - INTERESTING_QUOTA[rarity] cards that carry at least one KEYWORD ("non-vanilla" —
 *       these are the mechanically interesting bodies: Taunt/Deathrattle/Lifesteal/etc.),
 *       FIRST, because Core should favor decisions over french-vanilla stat sticks; then
 *     - VANILLA_QUOTA[rarity] keyword-less stat cards, a deliberate SMALL sampling so the
 *       curve still has clean, beginner-legible bodies at each faction/rarity.
 *
 *   Soft-banned (`disabled`) cards and non-deck card types (spells) are never eligible. The
 *   per-bucket caps keep the set balanced across faction and rarity rather than dominated by
 *   the huge STONE/IRON pools, and land the total comfortably inside the 150–300 design band.
 *
 * Because the rule is a pure, sorted, capped scan of the catalog, the resulting Core set is
 * identical on every run (server and client agree) and shifts only when the catalog itself
 * changes — exactly the "rotating legality" knob a curated format wants.
