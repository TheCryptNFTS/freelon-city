/**
 * abilityCompiler — Phase A of the effect system.
 *
 * Pure, deterministic compiler that turns a card's free-text mechanical ability
 * (`generatedTcgCards.json` -> `rawTraits.Ability`) into a typed Effect IR
 * (`EffectSpec[]`). NOTHING here mutates match state; this is the parse layer.
 * The resolver (Phase B) and reducer trigger wiring (Phase C) consume this IR.
 *
 * Two hard rules established by the Phase-A data investigation:
 *   1. "+X Attack. +Y Health." stat lines are STATIC — the printed stats are
 *      already baked into the live runtime tuple (verified 964/964). They must
 *      NOT become additive buffs or every stat doubles. We classify them as
 *      `STAT_LINE` (recognized, but emits no runtime op).
 *   2. Keywords already wired into the reducer (GUARD, DEATHRATTLE, LIFESTEAL,
 *      FLYING, EXECUTE, RUSH/CHARGE, CRUSH/TRAMPLE, SCRY, REGROW, WARD,
 *      DIVINE_SHIELD, ARMORED, STEALTH) are reminder-only here -> `KEYWORD_WIRED`
 *      (recognized, emits no op) so effects never double-fire.
 *
 * Only the genuinely-new clauses (Summon token, Rally, Judgment, Decay, Fear,
 * Patient, Oath/Vow/Martyr, Taunt riders, ...) compile to real ops.

// "last card played" / a per-match flag, nor a both-decks reveal-cull primitive —
// see the proof + agent report). All four are emitted at most once.

//   HEAL_ALLIES_FULL (tcg_3400) — "If you control another <X>, heal them to full
//     at start of your turn." A turn-start heal of the controller's OTHER allied
//     units to full, gated (in the resolver) on controlling at least one other
//     ally. REAL OP (ON_TURN_START).
//   REVEAL_AND_CULL  (tcg_3375) — "On play: both players reveal top 3. Units >=N
//     cost return to deck; others destroyed." Operates on BOTH decks with a reveal
//     window the state model has no representation for. RECOGNIZED NO-OP.
//   RETURN_LAST_PLAYED (tcg_3425) — "Once per match: return the last card played by
