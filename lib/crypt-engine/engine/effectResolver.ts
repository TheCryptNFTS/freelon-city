/**
 * effectResolver — Phase B of the effect system.
 *
 * Consumes the typed Effect IR from `abilityCompiler` (`EffectSpec`) and applies
 * a single effect to the LIVE match shape (`nexusHealth`, `board.front/back`,
 * `idCounter`-minted units). Mirrors the reducer's contract:
 *
 *   - IMPURE-IN-PLACE: it mutates the state it is handed. The reducer already
 *     `structuredClone`s once at entry, so the resolver composes inside it
 *     (Phase C) without a second clone. Proofs pass a fresh arena.
 *   - Deterministic: token instance ids are minted from `state.idCounter` using
 *     the same `unit_${seed}_${counter}` convention as `setup.makeInstanceId`,
 *     so summoned tokens are stable for a given (seed, action order).
 *
 * Scope: this layer resolves the seven ACTIVE ops the live corpus needs —
 * DEAL_DAMAGE, HEAL, BUFF_SELF, BUFF_ALLIES, DEBUFF_ENEMY, SUMMON_TOKEN, DRAW.
 * The two PASSIVE combat modifiers (PIERCE_ARMOR / RESTRICT_ATTACK) are NOT
 * one-shot effects — they alter combat legality/resolution and are consumed at
 * attack time (Phase C), so the resolver intentionally no-ops them here.
