/**
 * Curated "golden" SPELL fixtures.
 *
 * These are deliberately NOT part of `allPlayableCards`. Keeping them out of the
 * shipped catalog means they never touch deck legality, coreset balance, or the
 * card-count audits — adding a brand-new card category to the live pool is a
 * balance decision that hasn't been made yet. The reducer merges them into its
 * `cardMetaById` lookup so `PLAY_SPELL` can resolve them, and the `dev:spells`
 * proof drives them end-to-end. They also serve as the seed set for real,
 * balance-gated spell content later.
 *
 * Tiers:
 *   - `safe`: pure value (heal an ally, draw, buff an ally). No removal, no face
 *     damage. These mirror the conservative starter templates and are the only
 *     ones suitable to make deck-legal first.
 *   - `restricted`: single-target removal / tempo (deal damage, weaken). Cheap
 *     armor-bypassing removal is the most balance-sensitive effect in the game,
 *     so these stay fixture-only until a matchup-sim balance gate exists.
