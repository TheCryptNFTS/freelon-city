/**
 * THE reducer — the single, pure, server-authority-ready rules core.
 *
 * Everything players actually experience in the local Crypt match now flows
 * through `applyAction`. It consolidates what used to be split between
 * `engine/setup.ts` (card plays) and the React hook `useLocalCryptMatch.ts`
 * (combat, turn flow, draw, mulligan, win detection). The reducer reproduces
 * the HOOK's lived rules exactly — that is the behavior the owner's players
 * know — NOT setup.ts's old phase/summoning-sickness model.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - PURE. `structuredClone(state)` once at entry, mutate the copy, return it.
 *   - No `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` — all randomness is rebuilt from
 *     `state.seed` + `state.rngCursor` so `(seed, actionList)` fully determines
 *     the result on both client and (future) server.
 *   - Reject-soft: illegal actions return the state UNCHANGED plus a single
 *     REJECTED event, so an AI driver's per-action loop is a clean no-op.
 *   - SECURITY: card identity is taken from `player.hand[handIndex]`, never from
 *     a raw cardId in the action. Index-based validation only.
 *
 * RESOLUTION MODEL (no-stack, immediate, deterministic) — canonical reference:
 * see `src/engine/RESOLUTION_MODEL.md`. In brief:
 *   - NO STACK / NO PRIORITY / NO RESPONSES. Effects resolve IMMEDIATELY and
 *     depth-first the instant they trigger (Hearthstone / Marvel Snap style).
 *     This is a deliberate design choice, not a missing feature.
 *   - SIMULTANEOUS triggers/deaths from one action resolve in a STABLE board
 *     order: owner P1-before-P2, lane front-before-back, array index ascending
 *     (see `resolveDeaths`). Multi-token summons mint left-to-right via an
 *     ascending `idCounter`. Game-affecting logic NEVER depends on Object/Map/Set
 *     iteration order.
 *   - DEATHS are reaped by `resolveDeaths` after each trigger batch (firing each
 *     corpse's ON_DEATH/deathrattle before it is cleared), and continuous AURAS
 *     are recomputed idempotently at the single `applyAction` chokepoint.

 *  rather than being silently dropped to the next action. An on-death summon mints
