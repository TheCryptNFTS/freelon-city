 * Faction identities (#8) — give each of the five curated factions a DISTINCT,
 * mechanically meaningful identity, so deck / faction choice actually matters
 * instead of being a cosmetic color-swap.
 *
 *   STONE  (Keepers)   Bedrock   summoned same-faction units enter with +1 ARMOR
 *   SILVER (Sentinels) Insight   start of your turn: Scry 1 (deterministic smooth)
 *   BRONZE (Guardians) Onslaught summoned same-faction units costing <=2 gain RUSH
 *   IRON   (Defenders) Tempered  each equip ALSO grants the geared unit +1 ARMOR
 *   GOLD   (Sovereigns)Largesse  summoned same-faction units costing >=5 enter +0/+2
 *
 * DESIGN INVARIANTS (locked):
 *   - NO BURN. Nothing here touches an enemy nexus / commander / face. Every hook
 *     only adds armor / health / a RUSH keyword / smooths the controller's OWN
 *     deck. The cross-cutting proof asserts the enemy nexus is never lowered.
 *   - ADDITIVE + GATED. The whole system is inert unless `state.rules.factionIdentities`
 *     is true. Absent (the default) -> every hook is a clean no-op, so vanilla /
 *     golden matches are byte-identical (the flag is undefined and survives
 *     structuredClone, mirroring the alt-win meter / secrets de-risking pattern).
 *   - DISTINCT FROM COMMANDER PASSIVES. A faction identity keys off the unit's OWN
 *     faction matching the controller's faction; commander passives key off keyword
 *     / cost only. They stack cleanly on a different axis (e.g. Stone Warden gives a
 *     Guard +0/+2 HEALTH; STONE faction adds +1 ARMOR — orthogonal durability).
 *   - PURE-IN-PLACE. These mutate the already-cloned state the reducer hands them,
 *     exactly like effectResolver / commanderPassives.
 *
 * A controller whose commander is not one of the five curated commanders (every
 * generated NFT commander, the demo opponent) maps to NO faction -> clean no-op,
 * so identities only ever fire for an intentionally factioned deck.
 *
 * ARCHETYPE DEPTH (#8b) — on top of the single-trigger base identities above, each
 * faction earns a THRESHOLD payoff once the controller commands N+ of their OWN
 * faction's live units on board. This is what turns a color-swap into a real
 * archetype: a mono-faction commitment snowballs into a stronger identity.
 *
 *   STONE  3+ Stone units  -> Bedrock armor on summon deepens to +2 (a thicker wall)
 *   SILVER 3+ Silver units -> start-of-turn Scry deepens to Scry 2 (deeper smoothing)
 *   BRONZE 3+ Bronze units -> Onslaught Rush extends to cost<=3 (aggro snowball)
 *   IRON   3+ Iron units   -> equips ALSO grant +1 Attack on top of the +1 Armor
 *   GOLD   4+ Gold units   -> Largesse cost>=5 bonus deepens to +1/+3 (top-end payoff)
 *
 * The thresholds are RECOMPUTED from the live board at every trigger moment (never a
 * cached counter that could desync replay), ride a SECOND `rules.factionArchetypes`
 * gate ON TOP of `factionIdentities` (so the shipped CORE ruleset plays FLAT — base
 * identities only — and vanilla stays byte-identical), and remain NO-BURN:
 * every payoff only adds armor / attack / health / a keyword / deck smoothing to the
 * controller's OWN side, never touching the enemy nexus.

 *     count toward the threshold (countFactionUnits matches the unit's OWN faction).
