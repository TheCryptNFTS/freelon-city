 * TRAIT RESONANCE (#1 — the signature hook). The one-line pitch a newcomer can
 * hold in their head: "units that share a Keyword RESONATE — build around a
 * theme and your board strengthens itself." It's the mechanic that turns a pile
 * of owned cards into a deck with emergent synergy, on an axis distinct from the
 * five faction identities (which key off the unit's FACTION, not its keywords).
 *
 * THE RULE (legible on purpose — Billy's #1 ask is "less to understand"):
 *   When you summon a unit that shares at least one Keyword with ANOTHER unit you
 *   already control, the summoned unit enters RESONANT: +1 / +1.
 * Binary, not per-keyword-stacking — one clear trigger, one clear payoff. A turn-2
 * Guard next to a turn-1 Guard is +1/+1; a lone keyword does nothing.
 *
 * WHY KEYWORD (the pivot): the original pitch was COSMETIC-trait resonance
 * (Eye / Armor / Creature). Those traits exist ONLY in curatedCoreSetV2.json's
 * `.all` array — the in-engine catalog (`allPlayableCards.rawTraits`, surfaced as
 * `cardMetaById`) carries GAMEPLAY traits only. Keyword is the most legible axis
 * that is reliably present in BOTH the catalog AND the live `UnitInPlay.keywords`
 * array, so resonance reads straight off the board with no catalog lookup and is
 * exact under replay. Same payoff ("owned cards create synergy"), engine-feasible.
 *
 * DESIGN INVARIANTS (locked — identical to factionIdentity.ts so the two stack
 * cleanly and de-risk the same way):
 *   - NO BURN. The hook only adds +attack / +health to the CONTROLLER's own freshly
 *     summoned unit. It never touches an enemy nexus / commander / face. The proof
 *     asserts the enemy nexus is never lowered.
 *   - ADDITIVE + GATED. Inert unless `state.rules.traitResonance` is true. Absent ->
 *     a clean no-op, so vanilla / golden matches without the flag are byte-identical
 *     (undefined survives structuredClone, mirroring the identity / alt-win pattern).
 *   - DISTINCT AXIS. Faction identities key off the unit's FACTION matching the
 *     controller's; resonance keys off KEYWORD overlap with the live board. They
 *     stack orthogonally (a Stone Guard summoned beside another Guard can take BOTH
 *     the Bedrock +1 Armor AND the resonant +1/+1).
 *   - PURE-IN-PLACE. Mutates the already-cloned state the reducer hands it, exactly
 *     like factionIdentity / commanderPassives.
 *   - SELF-EXCLUDING. The summoned unit is already on its lane when the hook fires,
 *     so the "another unit" search skips its own instanceId — a unit never resonates
 *     with itself, and a first-of-its-keyword summon is correctly inert.
