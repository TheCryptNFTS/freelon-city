/**
 * CARD-OVERRIDE / VERSIONING LAYER — the balance-patch spine.
 *
 * Major TCGs (HS / MTG Arena / LoR) hot-patch card stats, text, and keywords
 * server-side without regenerating their whole catalog. This file is that hook
 * for the engine: a thin, deterministic, *versioned* layer that MODIFIES base
 * catalog entries on top of the generated data (`runtimeMatchPlayableCards.json`
 * + `generatedTcgCards.json`).
 *
 * Contract (deliberately narrow):
 *   - Overrides MODIFY or SOFT-DISABLE existing cards. They NEVER add or remove
 *     catalog entries — card-count audits stay green.
 *   - Applied once, at the single build chokepoint in `cards.ts`, so EVERYTHING
 *     downstream (reducer `cardMetaById`, `costOf`, `cardTypeOf`, `compileAbility`
 *     recompile path, deck legality, balance reports) inherits the patched values
 *     from one source of truth.
 *   - Deterministic: static data, fixed merge order, clone-then-override, no
 *     `Math.random` / `Date`. The version stamp is a literal string. The patched
 *     catalog is byte-identical across runs.
 *
 * To ship a balance patch: bump `CARD_OVERRIDES_VERSION`, add/adjust entries
 * below, re-run the gate sweep (`npm run dev:card-override` + the suites).

  // === HONESTY RETEXT: next tranche of unwired keyword riders (168 cards, 2026.05.31) ===
  // Same pattern as the 2026.06.02 tranche: each printed text led with a LIVE
  // keyword (Charge/Guard/Ward/Veil/Shield/Armored/Lifesteal/Trample/Scry/Regrow/
  // Deathrattle/Flying) but appended a conditional rider the compiler wires to NO
  // behaviorally-active op (verified zero active ops via the behavioral-coverage
  // audit before each retext). Retext drops the false rider, keeping ONLY the
  // reminder the reducer honors. No burn / no face-damage introduced; no static
  // stat line converted to a buff.

  // === INERT (note-only): spec-less placeholder artifacts (71 cards, 2026.06.02) ===
  // Ability text is the generic sentinel "Global effect active while in play."
  // (compiles to GLOBAL_UNPARSED — an engine no-op). Per the honesty rule we give
  // them NO invented behavior — the engine already does nothing with the text.
  // IMPORTANT: these 71 are ALL of cardClass "artifact", and they are the ENTIRE
  // artifact pool. Every commander spec (src/design/commanderSpecs.ts) requires
  // minArtifacts >= 1, so soft-banning them would make EVERY curated deck illegal
  // and break deck legality + regression. We therefore DOCUMENT them as inert but
  // leave them deck-legal (no `disabled` flag) — honest inert deck-fillers, not
  // fabricated content. IDs sorted for a stable diff.

  // SILVER_SENTINELS faction-balance pass (2026.06.02)
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // WHY: SILVER was the weakest faction in playtest (6.3% non-mirror WR). Root
  // cause is STRUCTURAL, not stats — SILVER's stat efficiency matches every
  // faction (2.21), but its cheap curve is built almost entirely from combat-
  // INERT keywords: WARD (anti-spell only), STEALTH (defensive evasion), SCRY
  // (deck-smoothing). It carries the LOWEST GUARD density of any faction (30 vs
  // STONE 445 / IRON 229 / BRONZE 196), so it can neither wall its own nexus nor
  // trade up — it simply gets ground out. (The faction-identity "Insight/Scry"
  // payoff is dormant in all live play + the harness, so it offers no offset.)
  //
  // FIX: turn the "Sentinels" into actual sentinels. Grant GUARD (real nexus
  // defence — the exact axis SILVER lacks) to its cheap watchers and bump bodies
  // a modest +1/+1, while KEEPING each card's existing evasion keyword
  // (WARD/STEALTH/LIFESTEAL) so the faction's identity reads through. One RUSH
  // skirmisher (tcg_2371, already Rush) is bumped for tempo flavour. SILVER-only,
  // no-burn (GUARD/STEALTH/WARD are static, never touch an enemy nexus), and
  // deterministic. These are the lowest-id cheap units the deck builders field
  // first, so the curve actually changes in play.
  // ==========================================================================

  // Calibration: keyword-only GUARD (original stats) left SILVER at 30.2%; a full
  // +1/+1 on top overshot to 66.7% (top faction, crushed aggro). The shipped buff
  // is the middle ground — GUARD + a MODEST stat bump: cost-1 chumps gain +0/+1
  // (stickier walls, same offence) and cost-2 bodies gain +1/+1. Each card keeps
  // its evasion keyword (WARD/STEALTH/LIFESTEAL) so the identity reads through.

  // === AUTHORED NAMES (2026.06.02) — the newcomer-facing default deck ===========
  // The 30 cards the curated CORE deck actually surfaces were procedurally named,
  // with collisions (four "Verdant Oath" variants, repeated "Watcher of the Veil")
  // and joke auto-names ("Mr LOL", "D'Vile One", "Octopus of Gilded Woe"). These
  // are NAME-ONLY overrides: purely cosmetic, zero effect on stats / cost /
  // compilation / legality / determinism (the reducer keys off card ids, so match
  // replay + the equivalence golden are byte-identical). Names stay inside each
  // faction's established aesthetic (Stone = geological/time, Iron = forge/martial,
  // Bronze = verdant/oath/growth, Silver = veil/insight/judgment, Gold = gilded/
  // sovereign). Cards already given good distinct names are deliberately left alone
  // (tcg_1676 Unyielding Bastion, tcg_1199 Judge of Shattered Reflections, tcg_1223
  // Scion of the Gilded Dawn, tcg_1243 Herald of the Scorpion Crown, tcg_3492
  // Frostbound Grimoire). Five more cards in this deck are renamed via their
  // existing balance/honesty entries above (tcg_1286, tcg_1668, tcg_101, tcg_1135,
  // tcg_3852). Deeper per-card ability/stat authoring is a separate, balance-gated pass.

  // ===========================================================================
  // The re-revealed catalog ships an authored on-chain Grade (≈0–100 power). The
  // grade-outlier report (src/dev/runGradeOutlierReport.ts) flags cards whose
  // on-board stat-sum is HIGH relative to that Grade vs their faction×rarity×cost
  // peers: "over-statted" = disagreement (gradeZ − statZ) < 0 with |disagreement|
  // > 2. These 68 COMMON-rarity cards carried no override and were over-statted.
  //
  // Each nerf trims ONLY attack/health (cost/keywords/abilities untouched),
  // pulling the inflated stat toward the class PEER stat line (the Grade-implied
  // target) — never below a 1/1 floor, never overcorrecting past the peer mean.
  // Stats only; conservative + reversible. See per-card `note` for the z-shift.
  //
  // Scope: COMMON over-statted no-override cards only. The report also flags 4
  // non-common over-statted bodies (tcg_3003/tcg_2164/tcg_2207 mythics, tcg_5739
  // epic) and ~27 commons already at/below their peer line (false positives —
  // power lives in ability text / Grade-z, not stat-sum); all are left untouched.

  // ===========================================================================
  // BALANCE PASS v2 — full-surface Grade-anchored sweep (2026-06-01).
  //
  // v1 (above) tuned 68 over-statted COMMONS. v2 extends coverage to ALL bands &
  // factions via runGradeOutlierReport.ts (|z|>2 within faction×rarity×cost-band).
  //
  // Method recap for this block: a card is auto-nerfed ONLY when its ON-BOARD
  // stat-sum z is genuinely positive (real inflation to trim) — not merely when its
  // authored Grade z is low. Cards flagged purely by a LOW Grade but sitting AT/below
  // their peer stat line (stat-z <= ~0) are UNDER-GRADED, not over-statted: there is
  // no inflated stat to shave without breaching the floor, so they are intentionally
  // left untouched. We also SKIP, by design:
  //   - 0/0 and "+X Attack / +Y Health / Grants ..." EQUIPMENT/relic cards: their
  //     power lives in TEXT, so a low printed stat line is a false positive.
  //   - any id that already carries an override (purely additive pass).
  //   - PREMIER cards (MYTHIC / LEGENDARY / 1-of-1s): flagged in the report, NOT
  //     auto-tuned — see the "FLAGGED, NOT TOUCHED" notes at the end of this block.
  //
  // After this sweep the ONLY genuinely over-statted (stat-z>2) real minion in the
  // whole 4129-card surface that lacked an override was tcg_5739; it is patched here.

  //   tcg_2164 "Eternal Echo of Silence"   Stone Keepers MYTHIC 7+  14/12@10  stat-z=+1.37  dis=-2.25
  // Several MYTHIC/LEGENDARY cards also flag UNDER-statted (e.g. tcg_2949 "The Dragon
  // Master" 4/6@7 G100, dis=+3.80) but carry heavy on-play text (summons/copies); their
  // low stat line is intentional, so they are likewise left for human review, not buffed.
